Description: backup tool based on Git
 Since gibak builds upon the infrastructure offered by Git, it shares its main
 strengths:
 * speed: recovering your data is faster that cp -a...
 * full revision history
 * space-efficient data store, with file compression and textual/binary deltas
 * efficient transport protocol to replicate the backup (faster than rsync)
 .
 gibak uses Git's hook system to save and restore the information Git doesn't
 track itself such as permissions, empty directories and optionally mtime
 fields.
